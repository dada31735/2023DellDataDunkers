This repo serves as a brief explanation and showcase of me and my teamates 2023 dell data dunkers submittion. We are grateful to McGill, Dell and the Pascal Siakam foundation for hosting both the 2023 McGill Hackathon and the 2023 Dell Data Dunkers challenge. We are thrilled to have won and excited to participate in any further events of the sort.

## Overview

This project provides an analysis of Pascal Siakam's career statistics, exploring his progression from a relatively late basketball starter to becoming a key player for the Toronto Raptors.
## Key Analysis Points

- **Career Progression**: The analysis highlights Siakam's performance trends throughout his career, focusing on his scoring, rebounding, and minutes played per game.
- **Leadership and Responsibility**: As Siakam took on more of a leadership role, the project analyzes how increased responsibility, such as playing more minutes and taking more shots, impacted his overall efficiency.
- **Efficiency Trends**: One of the main themes is Siakam's evolving efficiency as he transitions to being a superstar.
- **Comparison with 2016 Draft Class**: Using data from Basketball Reference, this project also places Siakam in the context of his 2016 draft class.
## Data Sources

The data for this project comes from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/), including:
- Pascal Siakam's career statistics
- 2016 NBA Draft Class statistics

## Tools & Libraries
The project only used python. We also used 2 librairies that let us easily access and manipulate data.

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Plotly Express**: For interactive data visualization and trend analysis.

## Execution & Reproducibility

- The notebook can be executed with:
  - [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
  - [Callysto](https://callysto.ca/)
  - [2i2c Hub](https://2i2c.org/)

The python code is also present.

Feel free to rerun the notebook with updated datasets to see the latest results, as NBA statistics change throughout the season.

## Achievements

- **Winning Submission**: This project ended up being a winner in the 2023 Dell Data Dunkers challenge.

## Initial Execution Results
Due to changing data, if you were to execute our original code from 2023 its possible it wouldnt work, and so screenshots of all the executions in 2023 have been provided in the images directory.
