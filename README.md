# Pascal Siakam Statistics

**Submitted by**: Dumitru Gliga and Noah Walsh

## Overview

This project provides an analysis of Pascal Siakam's career statistics, exploring his progression from a relatively late basketball starter to becoming a key player for the Toronto Raptors. Through data visualization and trend analysis, it examines various aspects of his gameplay over time, such as points per game, shooting percentages, and leadership role dynamics.

## Key Analysis Points

- **Career Progression**: The analysis highlights Siakam's performance trends throughout his career, focusing on his scoring, rebounding, and minutes played per game. By plotting these stats, we explored patterns and identified key turning points in his development.
  
- **Leadership and Responsibility**: As Siakam took on a more central role after the Raptors' 2019 championship, the project analyzes how increased responsibility, such as playing more minutes and taking more shots, impacted his overall efficiency. This includes a breakdown of shooting percentages (2-pointers and 3-pointers) as well as insights into how a higher usage rate influenced his performance.

- **Efficiency Trends**: One of the main themes is Siakam's evolving efficiency as he transitions to being a superstar. The notebook includes plots of his shooting percentages over the years, exploring whether his higher on-court involvement correlated with more or less effective gameplay.

- **Comparison with 2016 Draft Class**: Using data from Basketball Reference, this project also places Siakam in the context of his 2016 draft class. We examine how he stacks up against his peers in terms of total career points and focus on the top 5 scorers from that draft.

## Data Sources

The primary dataset for this analysis was retrieved from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/), including:
- Pascal Siakam's career statistics
- 2016 NBA Draft Class statistics

Additional data on comparable players from the draft class were also pulled to enrich the comparison.

## Tools & Libraries

- **Plotly Express**: For interactive data visualization and trend analysis.

## Execution & Reproducibility

- The notebook can be executed in various environments:
  - [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
  - [Callysto](https://callysto.ca/)
  - [2i2c Hub](https://2i2c.org/)

Feel free to rerun the notebook with updated datasets to see the latest results, as NBA statistics change throughout the season.

## Achievements

- **Winning Submission**: This analysis was awarded as a winning entry in the 2023 Dell Data Dunkers competition, demonstrating insightful trends and practical interpretations of Siakam's performance.

## Future Work

- Regular updates to include the latest stats as Siakamâ€™s career progresses.
- Additional comparison metrics for further insights into player efficiency and role evolution.
